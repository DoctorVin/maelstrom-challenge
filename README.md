# maelstrom-golang

## What even is this?
This is some golang code I am working on to address the Fly.io [distributed systems challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/). It is
mainly something to keep the grey matter working in this field. It gives me the chance to work out some concepts in a completely
green-field environment and use the power of [Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom) and its 
[golang bindings](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/tree/main/demo/go) to test it in in a very rigorous way.

Plus it's fun.
